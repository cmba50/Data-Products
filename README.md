This appplication is based on the mtcars dataset. It takes the selection of various predictors for MPG from user input.
The intention is to engage the user interactively in order to test the knwoledge on what makes the optimal set of feature variables that provide the best linear regreesion fit for predicting automobile MPG.
The user has the option to first select the variables, then either test directly the results or check the relationships between the selected variables and MPG. This intermediate step could be useful for gaining more insight in feature selection.
Feedback is provided on the user selection based on hypotesis testing and R-square values if applicable.
